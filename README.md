# Web-scapping: Scapping Book's Information
In the web scraping task, we aimed to extract data from a website using Python. Specifically, we focused on scraping information from a webpage that lists mystery books. By utilizing the requests library and BeautifulSoup package, we were able to retrieve the desired data from the webpage's HTML structure.

To construct a structured representation of the data, we stored each book's information in a dictionary. We then appended these dictionaries to a list, allowing us to accumulate the data from each book. Finally, we created a pandas DataFrame using the collected data, enabling easy manipulation and analysis of the extracted information.

By leveraging web scraping techniques, we were able to automate the process of extracting book details from the webpage, facilitating further analysis and exploration of the mystery book collection.
